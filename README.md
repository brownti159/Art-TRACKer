README

    Our team created an interactive, mobile-first app to explore public art installations in downtown Durham.  

    We are big fans of Durham and wanted to showcase some of the many creative features and artists of this city. 

    Also, in the age of Covid, we wanted to create a safe and engaging outdoor activity that would appeal to many different types of participants.

    The map-based app was developed using Python, a Django REST API framework, JavaScript, HTML and CSS/Tailwind.
